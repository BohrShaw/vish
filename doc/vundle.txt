Usage                                                           *vundle-usage*

You specify which bundles to include with a function and Vundle will download
it externally(manually) and ensure Vim loads them.

Generally, you include a bundle with a call to `Bundles('author/repo')`. There
are several variant functions which are defined in "autoload/bundle.vim".

The bundle format is "author/repo[:[branch]][/sub/directory]". If ":" is
included but "branch" is not, "branch" defaults to one of "linux_amd64",
"windows_386", "darwin_amd64" etc. depending on the OS.

`vundle`("src/vundle/vundle.go") is for managing bundles in the File System,
which including downloading, updating and cleaning bundles.
