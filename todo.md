# Project management
Task management tools wanted.(May consider tools in pure vim environment as long as
current project is small and the tool has enough power.)
Need tools for feature request, bug tracking etc.
I really should learn agile development and _practice_ to be a better developer.

# Change to pathogen to manage plugins
Vim plugins need to be familiar with before being a part of vim,
so the installation and removal of plugins
is not frequent. And for this reason pathogen is preferable than vundle as it's more
efficient than vundle and also as convenient as it.

# start to refactor vim to " vimrc <= vicrc => vilrc"
Figure out a way to let vim runtimepath to include the path vilrc located in.
Thus "vil" will use custom initialization directories(the "vil" folder).

# set vim to auto add a new line when the text inserting reaches window bargain
