# What's next?
Make a :B command to jump to a existing window containing the buffer you want to
switch to.

Write bundle description in more details in "bundles.md", and adjust the
"git-clone.sh" script accordingly.

upload a single vimrc to net, then use ":e http://example.com/vimrc"
to load and source my essential vimrc.

The branch pathogen is used to rebase on the vundle branch from time to time, so
I should carefully make a commit just for switching form vundle to pathogen
anytime.

# Project management
Task management tools wanted.(May consider tools in pure vim environment as long as
current project is small and the tool has enough power.)
Need tools for feature request, bug tracking etc.
I really should learn agile development and _practice_ to be a better developer.
